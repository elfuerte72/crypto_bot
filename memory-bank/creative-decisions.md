## [CREATIVE-001]: USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

### Decision: Single-Level Inline Keyboard with Smart Layout

**Components Affected**: Bot Handler Layer, Inline Keyboards

**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Single-Level Inline Keyboard with Smart Layout

**Key Design Decisions**:
- 16-button keyboard layout for all currency pair directions
- Mobile-first design optimized for Telegram
- One-click currency selection to prevent typing errors
- Smart keyboard layout with logical grouping
- FSM integration for calculation flow

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Keyboard Layout: 2-column format with directional pairs
- User Flow: Command → Keyboard → Selection → Result/FSM
- Message Templates: Rate display and calculation result formats
- Error Handling: Clear error messages with guidance

**Rationale**: Optimal balance between excellent UX and reasonable implementation complexity, eliminates user errors, mobile-optimized.

## [CREATIVE-002]: ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY

### Decision: Layered Error Handling with Circuit Breakers

**Components Affected**: All Services (Rate Service, Bot Handler, Notification Service, Cache Service, Configuration Service)

**Selected Approach**: Option 4 - Layered Error Handling with Circuit Breakers

**Key Architecture Decisions**:
- 4-layer error handling: Input Validation, Business Logic, External Services, System/Infrastructure
- Circuit breakers for all external dependencies (Rapira API, Telegram API, Redis)
- Centralized error classification and processing
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive fallback strategies

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Error Classification: ErrorCategory enum with severity levels
- Circuit Breaker: 5 failure threshold, 60s recovery timeout
- Service-specific error handlers for each external dependency
- Recovery strategies with fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring integration

**Rationale**: Critical for system resilience with external API dependencies, prevents cascade failures, provides excellent user experience during failures.

## [CREATIVE-003]: CACHING STRATEGY

### Decision: Hash-Based Hierarchical Caching

**Components Affected**: Rate Service, Cache Service

**Selected Approach**: Option 2 - Hash-Based Hierarchical Caching

**Key Architecture Decisions**:
- Redis hash-based storage for structured rate data
- Hierarchical key organization: rates:{from}:{to}, meta:{from}:{to}
- Dynamic TTL management based on usage patterns
- Cache warming for popular currency pairs
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Cache Structure: Redis hashes with rate data and metadata
- TTL Strategy: 60s default, dynamic adjustment based on popularity/reliability
- Cache Manager: Async operations with atomic updates
- Warming Strategy: Startup warming + usage-based warming
- Statistics: Hit rates, memory usage, popular pairs tracking

**Rationale**: Excellent balance of performance and structure, supports complex queries, memory efficient, scalable for additional features.

## [CREATIVE-004]: NOTIFICATION TEMPLATE DESIGN

### Decision: Interactive Messages with Action Buttons

**Components Affected**: Notification Service

**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Interactive Messages with Action Buttons

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Rich formatted messages with Markdown and emojis
- Interactive inline keyboards for manager responses
- Status tracking with message editing capabilities
- Professional business-appropriate formatting
- Multiple notification types (calculation, rate inquiry, admin alerts)

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Template Structure: Priority indicators, transaction details, action sections
- Interactive Elements: Approve/Reject/Hold/Contact buttons
- Status Updates: Dynamic keyboard updates based on current status
- Delivery Strategy: Retry logic with confirmation tracking
- Customization: Manager preferences and localization support

**Rationale**: Significantly improves manager productivity, provides professional interface, enables workflow automation, supports audit trails.
