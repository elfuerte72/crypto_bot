# Active Context - Crypto Bot Project

## Current Phase
**Mode**: CREATIVE MODE COMPLETE
**Status**: All Creative Phases Complete
**Phase**: Ready for Implementation
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT MODE

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive Telegram bot for cryptocurrency exchange rate calculations with:
- 8 currency pairs (RUB, USDT vs ZAR, THB, AED, IDR) in both directions
- Rapira API integration for real-time rates
- Configurable markup system
- Manager notification system
- Administrative controls

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack Selected**: Python 3.11+ with Aiogram 3.x framework
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Microservices-style with clear separation of concerns
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis with TTL for performance optimization
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Docker containerization with CI/CD pipeline

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Technology Validation**: Verify all selected technologies work together
2. **Creative Phase Planning**: 4 creative phases identified requiring design decisions
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented

## Creative Phase Results
1. **User Experience Design**: ✅ Single-Level Inline Keyboard with Smart Layout
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: ✅ Layered Error Handling with Circuit Breakers
3. **Caching Strategy**: ✅ Hash-Based Hierarchical Caching
4. **Notification Template Design**: ✅ Interactive Messages with Action Buttons

**Quality Score**: 44/50 (88%) - EXCEEDS THRESHOLD

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Begin systematic implementation starting with foundation setup
2. Execute technology validation during implementation
3. Follow implementation phases as defined in tasks.md

## Key Constraints
- Response time requirement: <500ms for all commands
- Cache hit rate target: >80%
- High availability requirement for production deployment
- Multi-language support (Russian interface based on requirements)

## Dependencies Identified
- External: Rapira API, Telegram Bot API, Redis
- Internal: Clear component dependencies mapped
- Integration points documented with specific requirements
